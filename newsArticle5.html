 <p> Hello! This is a meta article because I really don't enjoy writing articles about fake topics (and have already committed completely to not making this a site about real topics, NOT COMPLAINING it was still insanely fun).
  Barbie Q. is a character my friends played as in a choose your own adventure story a year or so back, the story started with her as president, so this is her prequel arc or something like
  that. The server is named Barbeque Bacon Burger so I still feel incredibly clever about naming her Barbie Q. <br>
  The characters Joshua Treeshucker and Fanta Fanta both come from a debate me and my friends hosted within our friend group. They are both characters that two of my friends played
  during the debate, Joshua Treeshuckers whole thing was that he loved deciduous trees, and Fanta Fanta's whole thing was that he was sponsored by Fanta. <br>
  This website was made because I like politics, plain and simple, it's incredibly fascinating. The choice to make it specifically not about politics is because I really wanted to
  make a campaign site, but also didn't necessarily want to have to spend a super long time researching topics (i have school and multiple extracurriculars to attend to). The news articles
  are short simply because I don't have the interest in worldbuilding this world. <br> The site is still meant to be somewhat interesting and look good, and be, while not an allegory
  to real world issues, something that can be easily turned to be about real world issues, if the need ever occurs.
