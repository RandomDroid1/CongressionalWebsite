My project is a mimic (parody? satire? whatever the word is) congressional website for a character me and my friends played as (Barbie Q.) in a choose your own adventure game a few years ago. It is just called Congressional Website (im so good at naming things)
I made my project to try and push my css and html knowledge a bit before I go and try and do python (which I know 0 python so thats gonna be tough), it was pretty fun.
I made my project using VScode and a lot of time, also https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp was really helpful, helped me understand a lot of concepts I did not know existed before this.
I struggled with a lot, particularly flexbox and getting things to line up right, but I made it happen. I learned a lot more than I thought I would, and understand how to make a website, and how to put things in the right spot 
(and how to style things with a bit more accuracy, and how to make a footer section)
