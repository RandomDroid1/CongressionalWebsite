 <p> Early yesterday, Representative Barbie Q. took the floor to denounce the most recent presidential debate: "For years the people have asked for better representatives. 
    This recent debate shows that we have made no progress, it was an unmitigated and total disaster. Joshua Treeshucker and Fanta Fanta both were unable to compete with a random man
    who walked on to the debate stage. Mr. Treeshucker has been an ally of mine in the past, however his performance in this debate was an abject failure" <br>
    The presidential debate, which happened this weekend, has quickly drawn sharp criticism from both sides of the aisle, with many saying that it is a sign of a 'lack of improvement' from
    the federal government, and even some calling it a sign of 'decay'. Barbie Q. understands, and even agrees with these concerns.
