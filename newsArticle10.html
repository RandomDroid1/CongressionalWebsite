 <p>Rep. Barbie Q. has won a supposedly competitive election by over 20 points, a unprecedented landslide for a competetive area,
    and a major win not just for the party, but for the entirety of America. With this re-election, Barbie Q. will prioritize the people's
    needs.
    <br>
    "This session of congress gives us a unique opportunity, the opportunity to do better, the opportunity to fight for everyone, the opportunity to create peace, and the opportunity to move forward. Together, we as
    a country can take the first step, the first step to create something better. Together we will institute new policies to limit corruption, to protect the environment, to create new jobs and infrastructure
    for millions of Americans" said Barbie Q in a press conference today. In the same press conference she called out the executive branch for it's 
    constant failure to implement policies approved by congress and supported by the American people. The veto of the Transport bill was a critical failure
    that we will feel the impact of for decades. <br>
    Barbie Q. pledges to serve her district with dedication and determination.
