 <!-- Text -->
 <p> Early August morning, a wild herd of traffic cones blocked the path for many civilians and politicans attempting to reach the capitol. 
    The herd was quickly dispersed by animal control using red lights and construction noises to lead them back to their natural habitat. 
    This has brought attention to the issue of Traffic cone Habitats being eroded, an issue Barbie Q. has spent a lot of time working against.
    Historically Traffic Cones have stayed in their natural habitat, but due to increased development in areas commonly housing traffic cones, they have found
    themselves interuppting city life more and more often, both to the detriment of themselves and passerbys. <br>
